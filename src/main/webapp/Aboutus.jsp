        In a similar vein to the first two points, make it easy for customers to do the thing they want to do. Online ordering is already widespread and continues to increase in volume across the industry. If you don’t offer online ordering - for takeout and/or delivery - you may be missing out on a huge additional revenue stream. And if you do offer online ordering, make it easy for customers to find it on your website! While online ordering sites like GrubHub and Foodler provide the reach and functionality for online ordering, they also come with big fees. If you have a customer already on your website, take advantage of that and let them order straight through your website. Upper Crust Pizzeria, like many pizzerias, does a lot of business via online orders. They prominently display a button at the top of their website to let visitors quickly and easily place an order.
            Loyalty programs were created to help restaurants reward their best customers and to encourage repeat visits to create new regulars. Consumers estimate a restaurant loyalty program would increase their visit rate to a restaurant by an average of 35%, and when a customer is about to unlock their loyalty reward, they spend 39% more on average. If you have a loyalty program, make it easy for customers to check their status online, like Costa Vida offers through the “<b>Project Foood</b>” section of their website.
